This repository contains an Android application built to enhance women's safety. The application includes a trigger function that can be activated through various methods such as phone shake, triple click power button, or by speaking "help, help, help." When triggered, the application sends the user's location, along with a few random pictures and recorded audio, to pre-defined emergency contacts, including family members and the nearest police station.

The application is built using Java in Android Studio and leverages the device's sensors, audio recording capabilities, and location services to provide a quick and efficient safety solution for women. The codebase emphasizes modularity, maintainability, and user-friendly interfaces, ensuring ease of use for both developers and end-users.
